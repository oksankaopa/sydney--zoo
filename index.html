      The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an
      arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant
      representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living
      relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the
      mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South
      Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognizable by its
      stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large,
      spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60‚Äì85 cm (24‚Äì33 in) and
      weighs 4‚Äì15 kg (9‚Äì33 lb). Fur color ranges from silver gray to chocolate
      brown.

      One of the most fascinating and unusual Australian animals, the
      duck-billed platypus, along with the echidna, are the only known
      monotremes, or egg-laying mammals, in existence. The platypus is generally
      found in permanent river systems and lakes in southern and eastern NSW and
      east and west of the Great Dividing Range.

    <p>
      The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods,
      meaning "large foot"). In common use the term is used to describe the
      largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the
      antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey
      kangaroo.Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The
      kangaroo is a symbol of Australia, appears on the Australian coat of arms
      and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's
      most well-known organisations. The kangaroo is important to both
      Australian culture and the national image.
